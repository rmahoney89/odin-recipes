        <h2>How to make a basic bechamel sauce</h2>
        <p>The basic white sauce, also known as béchamel, is not just used in a variety of dishes—it's also the base for many other sauces. It's easy to make and uses just a few common ingredients that are likely already in your kitchen.</p>
        <p>You'll start by making a roux from butter and flour, then season it with salt and pepper, stir in milk, and cook until it's thick. The trick to avoiding lumps is to keep stirring, and controlling the heat will prevent scorching. Follow the recipe's steps and tips, and you'll add this versatile ingredient to your cooking repertoire.</p>
        <p>With a little additional seasoning, this medium white sauce can be poured over vegetables or biscuits as a basic gravy. You can also vary the thickness to match any dish you're making. Cream soups call for a thin white sauce; a medium one is typically used in casseroles or in a more complex gravy. Thick and heavy white sauces are generally found in soufflé and croquette batters. You'll find instructions for all the thickness levels you'll need as well as several popular sauce variations.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbs butter</li>
            <li>2 tbs all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>Dash of freshly-ground black pepper</li>

          </ul>

          <h3>Steps</h3>

              <li>Over medium heat, melt butter in saucepan</li>
              <li>Whisk the flour into the melted butter.</li>
              <li>Add the salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
              <li>Cook over low heat, stirring, for a full 2 minutes to minimize the taste of the flour. If your mixture is thickening slowly, continue cooking in 30-second intervals until thick and bubbly.</li>
              <li>Turn up the heat slightly, then slowly add the milk, stirring constantly.</li>
              <li>Bring to a low simmer and continue cooking slowly until the white sauce is smooth and thickened, about 10 minutes.</li>
